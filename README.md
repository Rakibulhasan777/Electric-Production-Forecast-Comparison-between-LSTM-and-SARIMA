# Electric-Production-Forecast-Comparison-between-LSTM-and-SARIMA

This project focuses on forecasting electric production using historical time-series data. The model leverages advanced machine learning and statistical techniques to capture patterns, seasonality, and trends in electricity generation. Accurate forecasting of energy production is crucial for:

Ensuring reliable power grid management

Supporting sustainable energy policies

Optimizing resource allocation and planning

# Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of trends, seasonality, and consumption patterns.

Time-Series Forecasting Models: Implements ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM-based deep learning approaches to predict future electricity production.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and train-test splitting for robust modeling.

isualization: Clear plots for actual vs. predicted values, residuals, and performance metrics.

Evaluation: Compares model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

# Future Improvements
Incorporate exogenous factors (weather, economic indicators) for more robust predictions.

Deploy model as an interactive web app using Streamlit or Flask.

Automate retraining pipeline for real-world energy forecasting.
